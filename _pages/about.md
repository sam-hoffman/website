# Hi! I'm Sam.  
  
  
Here's some info about me:
 * I'm from Denver, CO
 * I live in Portland, OR now, but in the past I've lived in Samsun, Turkey; Chicago, Istanbul, and Paris
 * I studied statistics 📈 and Turkish 🇹🇷 at the University of Chicago, where I also worked as a research assistant with Dr. Rena Conti modeling the effect of hepatitis drugs on the market for donor organs
 * I now work at Graphika (located in NYC, although I still live in Portland) as a data engineer! I spend my days writing lots of Python, and am looking forward to also wrestling with AWS. 
 * I used to work for Cascade Data Labs in Portland. 
 * Some of the cooler unpaid things I've done in the past include newspaper layout design and editing, ski patrol, and organizing the University of Chicago climbing club
 * The one cool unpaid thing I'm doing now is helping organize the [Portland PyData](https://pdx.pydata.org) group
 * In my free time, I enjoy climbing 🧗, running 🏃‍♀️, cooking 🍪, travelling ✈️, and learning new things 📚

<h2 id="website">What's up with this website?</h2>
Although my day job is in data wrangling, this website is a product of my efforts to teach myself new skills, particularly around web design. 
In the long term, I'm interested in acquiring the skills to make web-based data visualizations with D3 and other JavaScript tools.
  
This website is an about me and hopefully soon a portfolio, but it's also an experiment and a learning tool. 
I made this site basically from scratch with Jekyll.
As this is the first project I've ever done with HTML and CSS, I welcome bug reports/comments/critiques and questions - feel free to contact me through any of the options above.

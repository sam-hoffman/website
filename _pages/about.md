Hi! I'm Sam.  
  
  
Here's some info about me:
 * I'm from Denver, CO
 * I live in Portland, OR now, but in the past I've lived in Samsun, Turkey; Chicago, Istanbul, and Paris
 * I studied statistics 📈 and Turkish 🇹🇷 at the University of Chicago, where I also worked as a research assistant with Dr. Rena Conti modeling the effect of hepatitis drugs on the market for donor organs
 * I now work at Cascade Data Labs in Portland as a data analyst. I spend my days building and training predictive models and putting them into production, building data pipelines with Luigi, Airflow, and unconsionable amounts of SQL; and making dashboards
 * Some of the cooler unpaid things I've done in the past include newspaper layout design and editing, ski patrol, and organizing the University of Chicago climbing club
 * The one cool unpaid thing I'm doing now is helping organize the [Portland PyData](https://pdx.pydata.org) group
 * In my free time, I enjoy climbing 🧗, running 🏃‍♀️, cooking 🍪, travelling ✈️, and learning new things 📚

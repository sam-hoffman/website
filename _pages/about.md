Hi! I'm Sam.  
  
  
Here's some info about me:
 * I'm from Denver, CO
 * I live in Portland, OR now, but in the past I've lived in Samsun, Turkey; Chicago, Istanbul, and Paris
 * I studied statistics 📈 and Turkish 🇹🇷 at the University of Chicago, where I also worked as a research assistant with Dr. Rena Conti modeling the effect of hepatitis drugs on the market for donor organs
 * I now work at Cascade Data Labs in Portland as a data analyst. I spend my days building and training predictive models and putting them into production, building data pipelines with Luigi, Airflow, and unconsionable amounts of SQL; and making dashboards
 * Some of the cooler unpaid things I've done in the past include newspaper layout design and editing, ski patrol, and organizing the University of Chicago climbing club
 * The one cool unpaid thing I'm doing now is helping organize the [Portland PyData](https://pdx.pydata.org) group
 * In my free time, I enjoy climbing 🧗, running 🏃‍♀️, cooking 🍪, travelling ✈️, and learning new things 📚

<strong id="website">What's up with this website?</strong><br>
Although my day job is in data wrangling, this website is a product of my efforts to teach myself new skills, particularly around web design. 
In the long term, I'm interested in acquiring the skills to make web-based data visualizations with D3 and other JavaScript tools, and in being able to put them on the web and make them useful to people.  
  
This website is an about me and hopefully soon a portfolio, but it's also an experiment and a learning tool. 
As of December 2019, this is the first project I've ever done with HTML and CSS, and so I welcome bug reports/comments/critiques and questions.

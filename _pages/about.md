# Hi! I'm Sam.  
  
  
Here's some info about me:
 * I'm from Denver, CO
 * I work at Particle Health as a backend engineer, trying to make medical records suck less. 
 * I live in the Bay Area now, but in the past I've lived in Samsun, Turkey; Chicago, Istanbul, and Paris, and Portland, OR.
 * I studied statistics 📈 and Turkish 🇹🇷 at the University of Chicago, where I also worked as a research assistant with Dr. Rena Conti modeling the effect of hepatitis drugs on the market for donor organs
 * In the past I worked for Cascade Data Labs in Portland and Graphika in New York City. 
 * Some of the cooler unpaid things I've done in the past include newspaper layout design and editing, ski patrol, and organizing the University of Chicago climbing club
 * In my free time, I enjoy climbing 🧗, running 🏃‍♀️, skiing ⛷️, cooking 🍪, travelling ✈️, and learning new things 📚 (now including guitar 🎸, watercolors 🖌️, and foraging for mushrooms 🍄)

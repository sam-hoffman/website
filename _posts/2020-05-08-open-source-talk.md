title: Lightning talk on open source!
---

I'm feeling nostalgic today about PyData Portland, as we look forward to an uncertain future of remote-only meetings just as the network effects were starting to kick in and the community was starting to get good :( 

In honor of that nostalgia, here's a lightning talk I gave at our last meeting about contributing to open source!

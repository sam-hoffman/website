title: First blog post!

This is my first blog post to celebrate my first website deployment! Hopefully more to come.   

I'm hoping that the first couple of real blog posts will include:  
  * How to make a website with Jekyll from scratch when your only experience with HTML is, like, a little bit of webscraping
  * A lesson learned at work: how to use `xlsxwriter` to programatically enforce custom data validation in Excel spreadsheets
  * The importance of people-handling skills in addition to data-handling skills, and some of the things that I've learned 
  * Redoing the website with responsive design so it looks good on phones/other size screens and the struggles that I expect to accompany that

I expect about three people (maybe) to read this post, but if any of you have questions or if there are blog posts you want to see, feel free to reach out and ask!

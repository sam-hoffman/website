title: First blog post!
---

This is my first blog post to celebrate my first website deployment! Hopefully more to come.   

I'm hoping that the first couple of real blog posts will include:  
  * How to make a website with Jekyll from scratch when your only experience with HTML is, like, a little bit of webscraping
  * A lesson learned at work: how to use `xlsxwriter` to programatically enforce custom data validation in Excel spreadsheets
  * The importance of people-handling skills in addition to data-handling skills, including some of the skills that I've learned and some of the skills that I'm still working on
  * An update about redoing this website with responsive design (mobile-first design is the future? but honestly I'm proud to have gotten something on the web to start with)

I expect about three people (maybe) to read this post, but if any of you have questions or if there are blog posts you want to see, feel free to reach out and ask!
